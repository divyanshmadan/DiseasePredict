# DiseasePredict

ReadMe

The project uses the following algorithm:

Part A:
1. We take input of DNA sequence in the form of a string. 
2. The occurrences of four character (A, C, G and T) are counted in the DNA sequence.
3. All the permutations possible for these characters are registered for calculating the frequency of occurrence in DNA sequence.
4. The variations of a normal breast gene to a diseased breast gene are calculated.
5. The pattern with the maximum variation would discriminate a normal gene from the diseased one. 
6. Any new DNA sequence which is registered in our application would be segmented to form a part of a normal or the disease category based on maximum varied pattern.

Part B:
All the Lifestyle Related fields like Age, Menopause, Height, Weight, Alcohol Consumption, Age Menarche, Hormone Therapy are taken as input.
These are then compared against the training data set computed average values.
Based on the Decision tree and deviation from average values, the percentage of having Breast Cancer is predicted.

To run it we need to follow the following steps:

Enter the details in the Lifestyle Form.
The percentage value of having breast cancer is displayed on screen in the form of the pie-chart.
Visit the Dashboard.
The Dashboard is updated as per the values entered in the Lifestyle Form.
Enter the details in the DNA Sequence Form.
The percentage value of having breast cancer is displayed on screen in the form of the pie-chart.
Visit the Dashboard to check for the updated risk factors percentage related to DNA Sequence.
